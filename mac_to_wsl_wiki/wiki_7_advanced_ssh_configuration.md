# Advanced SSH Features and Configuration

## What we'll do in this guide

In this guide, we'll explore advanced SSH features that can make your remote work more productive:

1. Setting up X11 forwarding to run graphical applications
2. Using SSH tunneling for secure access to services
3. Setting up SSH multiplexing for faster connections
4. Managing multiple SSH connections with your config file
5. Using SSH agent for convenient key management

## What are these features?

These advanced features let you do more with your SSH connection:

- **X11 forwarding**: Run graphical Linux applications and have them display on your Mac
- **SSH tunneling**: Create secure "tunnels" to access web services or databases
- **SSH multiplexing**: Make connections faster by reusing existing connections
- **SSH config management**: Easily manage multiple SSH connections
- **SSH agent**: Manage your SSH keys securely and conveniently

## Step 1: Setting up X11 forwarding

X11 forwarding lets you run graphical Linux applications remotely and have them display on your Mac.

### 1.1: Install XQuartz on your Mac

1. Download XQuartz from https://www.xquartz.org/

2. Install it by opening the downloaded .dmg file and following the installation instructions

3. After installation, restart your Mac

### 1.2: Configure SSH server for X11 forwarding

1. Connect to your Ubuntu system:
   ```bash
   ssh windows-wsl
   ```

2. Install X11 apps for testing:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install x11-apps -y
   ```

3. Edit the SSH server configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

4. Find or add these lines:
   ```
   X11Forwarding yes
   X11DisplayOffset 10
   ```

5. Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

6. Restart the SSH service:
   ```bash
   sudo service ssh restart
   ```

### 1.3: Configure your Mac for X11 forwarding

1. Edit your SSH config file:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.ssh/config
   ```

2. Add the `ForwardX11 yes` option to your windows-wsl configuration:
   ```
   Host windows-wsl
       HostName 192.168.1.5
       User your-ubuntu-username
       Port 22
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
       ServerAliveInterval 60
       ServerAliveCountMax 3
       ForwardX11 yes
   ```

3. Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

### 1.4: Test X11 forwarding

1. Make sure XQuartz is running on your Mac

2. Connect to your Ubuntu system with X11 forwarding:
   ```bash
   ssh windows-wsl
   ```

3. Run a simple X11 application:
   ```bash
   xclock
   ```

   You should see a clock window appear on your Mac screen.

4. Try another application:
   ```bash
   xeyes
   ```

   You should see a pair of eyes that follow your mouse cursor.

5. Close the applications when you're done testing.

## Step 2: SSH tunneling

SSH tunneling lets you securely access services running on your Ubuntu system or even on other computers in your network.

### 2.1: Local port forwarding

Local port forwarding lets you access a remote service as if it were running on your Mac.

1. Let's install a web server on Ubuntu for testing:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install apache2 -y
   ```

2. Start the web server:
   ```bash
   sudo service apache2 start
   ```

3. On your Mac, create an SSH tunnel:
   ```bash
   ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 windows-wsl
   ```

   This forwards your Mac's port 8080 to port 80 on your Ubuntu system.

4. Open a web browser on your Mac and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

   You should see the Apache default page.

### 2.2: Remote port forwarding

Remote port forwarding lets you expose a service on your Mac to your Ubuntu system.

1. On your Mac, start a simple HTTP server for testing:
   ```bash
   cd ~
   echo "<html><body><h1>Hello from Mac</h1></body></html>" > index.html
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. In another Terminal window on your Mac, create a remote tunnel:
   ```bash
   ssh -R 8000:localhost:8000 windows-wsl
   ```

   This forwards port 8000 on your Ubuntu system to port 8000 on your Mac.

3. On your Ubuntu system, access the web server:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000
   ```

   You should see the HTML content from your Mac.

4. Press Ctrl+C in the Terminal window running the Python HTTP server to stop it.

## Step 3: SSH multiplexing

SSH multiplexing reuses existing connections, making subsequent connections much faster.

1. Edit your SSH config file:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.ssh/config
   ```

2. Add multiplexing options to your windows-wsl configuration:
   ```
   Host windows-wsl
       HostName 192.168.1.5
       User your-ubuntu-username
       Port 22
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
       ServerAliveInterval 60
       ServerAliveCountMax 3
       ForwardX11 yes
       ControlMaster auto
       ControlPath ~/.ssh/control:%h:%p:%r
       ControlPersist 1h
   ```

   These options:
   - `ControlMaster auto`: Enables multiplexing
   - `ControlPath`: Specifies where to store the control socket
   - `ControlPersist 1h`: Keeps the master connection open for 1 hour after you log out

3. Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

4. Test multiplexing:
   - Connect to your Ubuntu system: `ssh windows-wsl`
   - In another Terminal window, connect again: `ssh windows-wsl`
   - The second connection should be much faster

## Step 4: Managing multiple SSH connections

You can use your SSH config file to manage multiple connections with different settings.

1. Edit your SSH config file:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.ssh/config
   ```

2. Add a section for default settings and another connection:
   ```
   # Default settings for all hosts
   Host *
       ServerAliveInterval 60
       ServerAliveCountMax 3
       ForwardAgent no
       
   # Your WSL connection
   Host windows-wsl
       HostName 192.168.1.5
       User your-ubuntu-username
       Port 22
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
       ForwardX11 yes
       ControlMaster auto
       ControlPath ~/.ssh/control:%h:%p:%r
       ControlPersist 1h
       
   # Example of another connection
   Host example-server
       HostName example.com
       User your-username
       Port 22
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

3. Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

Now you can connect to different servers using their shortcut names:
```bash
ssh windows-wsl
ssh example-server
```

## Step 5: Using SSH agent

SSH agent remembers your keys and their passphrases, so you don't have to type them repeatedly.

1. Start the SSH agent (if it's not already running):
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

2. Add your SSH key to the agent:
   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

   If your key has a passphrase, you'll be prompted to enter it once.

3. Verify that your key is loaded:
   ```bash
   ssh-add -l
   ```

   You should see your key listed.

4. Now you can connect without entering your passphrase each time:
   ```bash
   ssh windows-wsl
   ```

### 5.1: Making SSH agent persistent (macOS)

On macOS, you can make the SSH agent remember your keys across restarts:

1. Edit your shell configuration file:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.zshrc  # For macOS Catalina and newer
   # OR
   nano ~/.bash_profile  # For older macOS versions
   ```

2. Add these lines:
   ```bash
   # Start SSH agent if not running
   if [ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ]; then
       eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
       ssh-add -A 2>/dev/null
   fi
   ```

3. Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

4. Apply the changes:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc  # For macOS Catalina and newer
   # OR
   source ~/.bash_profile  # For older macOS versions
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### X11 forwarding issues

1. Make sure XQuartz is running on your Mac
2. Check that the DISPLAY environment variable is set:
   ```bash
   echo $DISPLAY
   ```
   It should show something like "localhost:10.0"
3. Try connecting with verbose output:
   ```bash
   ssh -vX windows-wsl
   ```

### SSH tunneling issues

1. Check if the port is already in use:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :8080
   ```
2. Make sure the service you're trying to access is running
3. Try specifying the bind address:
   ```bash
   ssh -L 127.0.0.1:8080:localhost:80 windows-wsl
   ```

### SSH agent issues

1. Check if the agent is running:
   ```bash
   echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
   ```
   If it returns nothing, the agent isn't running
2. Restart the agent:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```
